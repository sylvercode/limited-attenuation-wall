# Sylvercode Enhance Limited Wall

Enhance limited wall vision of Foundry VTT.

# Development

A dev container [configuration](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) ([see][1]) is provided. It is recommended to make a personal configuration with mounts to your foundry installation and data folder for easier testing and debugging. Copy the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to `.devcontainer/personal/devcontainer.json` and follow instruction in comments. This personal folder and suggested mount point are set to be ignored by git.
